Diversity and geographical variation in the microbiome of New Zealand’s key amphipods: the sandhopper Bellorchestia quoyana

#ABSTRACT OF THE STUDY
Microbiomes comprise the entirety of microorganisms, that is from viruses to fungi and protists which occur in a particular habitat, including their genes. Therefore, the microbiome of a given species comprises all these microorganisms living within it. Invertebrate microbiomes have been the focus of increasing research interest thanks to powerful sequencing and computational advances now available. However, studies of such microbiomes around New Zealand are still sparse. The sandhopper Bellorchestia quoyana is the most abundant amphipod of New Zealand’s shorelines and plays vital roles in decomposing and recirculating nutrients from stranded algae and dead animals. Sandhoppers and their close relatives have been the subject of several ecological studies. Such studies have assessed the impact of anthropogenic factors such as tourism and pollution, determined population genetic structure, and investigated host-parasite interactions. Yet, we know nothing about the sandhopper’s microbiome - that is, all of the viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoan species living within sandhoppers, and how this microbiome might vary across coastal ecosystems. The genetic structure of this species has been established in the past and allows for consolidation of the model species through microbiome studies. In this thesis I sought to characterise the microbiome of New Zealand’s sandhoppers using a metatranscriptomic approach. Microbiomes were compared among sites and microbiome patterns identified. Microbiomes were species-rich for every population of sandhoppers, but this diversity was different among populations, with various taxa more or less represented. I also demonstrated that the further apart sandhopper populations live from one another, the greater the dissimilarity in their microbiome. Finally, I performed in-depth analysis of the viral and protists diversity and unveiled three new virus species belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae, Nyamiviridae and Picornavirales as well as the protist Uronema marinum. We also suspect the presence of a species from the Trypanosomatidae family, but further testing is needed to confirm this. Overall, New Zealand sandhoppers harbour a rich microbiome, with a mix of land-dwelling and marine organisms due to their coastal position. A slight distance-decay pattern in the microbiome of the sandhoppers and new viral lineages have been identified. This study contributes empirically to the discovery and characterisation of microbial diversity in a keystone species residing in the interface between land and sea. The lack of exhaustivity in current microbial databases, failing to capture many components of the microbiome often resulting in “unknown” taxonomic classifications in many metatranscriptomic studies emphasise the need for more descriptions such as this one. Only then will we be able to achieve a thorough understanding of the exhaustive composition and function of microbes in a given ecosystem.![image](https://github.com/jerem974/Sandhopper_Microbiome_NZ/assets/108312639/0b784604-45ea-4c95-b3ce-a072c1d254bb)
